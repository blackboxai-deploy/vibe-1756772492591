# 3D Bee-Themed Website Implementation

## Phase 1: Core 3D Setup
- [ ] Install Three.js and React Three Fiber dependencies
- [ ] Set up basic 3D scene with camera and lighting
- [ ] Create initial bee model with basic animations
- [ ] Implement honeycomb grid structure
- [ ] Add basic particle system

## Phase 2: Advanced Animations
- [ ] Develop realistic bee flight physics
- [ ] Create interactive honeycomb expansions
- [ ] Implement dynamic lighting responses
- [ ] Add advanced particle effects
- [ ] Integrate sound system

## Phase 3: UI Integration
- [ ] Create responsive honeycomb navigation
- [ ] Build content modal systems
- [ ] Add loading animations
- [ ] Implement sound controls
- [ ] Optimize for mobile devices

## Phase 4: Performance & Polish
- [ ] Implement LOD systems
- [ ] Add device-based performance tiers
- [ ] Optimize particle systems
- [ ] Fine-tune animations
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Build & Testing
- [ ] Build application with `pnpm run build --no-lint`
- [ ] Start server with `pnpm start`
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl
- [ ] Validate 3D rendering and animations
- [ ] Test responsive design across devices
